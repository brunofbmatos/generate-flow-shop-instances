o car1-car8 are from 
   J. Carlier (1978),
   Ordonnancements a contraintes disjonctives,
   R.A.I.R.O. Recherche operationelle/Operations Research 12, 333-351. 
o hel1-hel2 are from 
   J. Heller (1960),
   Some numerical experiments for an MxJ flow shop and its decision-
   theoretical aspects,
   Operations Research 8, 178-184.
o reC01-reC42 are from 
   C.R. Reeves (1995),
   A genetic algorithm for flowshop sequencing,
   Computer Ops Res 22, 5-13.
   (Only odd-numbered instances are given, since the even-numbered instances 
   are obtained from the previous instance by just reversing the processing
   order of each job; the optimal value of each odd-numbered instance and 
   its even-numbered counterpart is the same.)
 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each instance consists of a line of description, a line containing the 
number of jobs and the number of machines, and then one line for each job,
listing the machine number and processing time for each step of the job. 
The machines are numbered starting with 0.
